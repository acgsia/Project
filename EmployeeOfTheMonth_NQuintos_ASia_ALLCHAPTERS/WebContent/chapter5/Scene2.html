		"Hey, Daniel, I think my computer is infected with virus. Can you help me fix it?" Says Eliot.
		"Sure, wait let me scan it... Hmmm. There is a file that can't be cleaned and can't be deleted.
		It's an audio file. Want to play it?" asks Daniel.
		"Sure..."
		After clicking play a man who seems going crazy is heard:
		*audio plays* "If you are hearing this then you are probably sitting at my old computer table.
		I am an employee at the Developer's Department of a little company of Capstone.
		I am making this record to tell my sins to whomever who is listening to this audio.
		I stopped the death chain. And I did it by killing the guest employee, the real Employee-of-the-Month.
		There is no way but to guess to find out who is the Employee-of-the-Month but to start killing the employees.
		To the future employees... I wish you good luck." *audio stops*
